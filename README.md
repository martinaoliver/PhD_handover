# PhD_handover
This repository contains code tutorials that describe the algorithms used in my PhD Thesis "Data-driven modelling of robust Turing patterns in synthetic biofilms".
This work was produced under the supervision of Prof. Robert Endres and Prof. Mark Isalan at Imperial College London. 

The following sections are presented
- PDE Numerical solvers in 1D (Crank-Nicolson) and 2D (Alternating implicit direction method)
- Cellular automata model for bacterial colony growth
- Linear stability analysis for reaction-diffusion PDE systems
- Latin hypercube sampling 
- Code parallelisation
- High Performance Computing Cluster access
